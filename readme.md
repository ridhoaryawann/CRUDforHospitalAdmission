## About

The Hospital Admission CRUD Function was released in 2023 by Nurridho Aryawan. The Hospital Admission CRUD Function created as a part of Capstone Project 1 in Purwadhika Data Science Bootcamp. The Hospital Admission CRUD Function offers five features including:

1. **Read**, The Hospital Admission CRUD Function displays the entire patient database in hospitals. Additionally, it allows for filtered searches based on parameters such as gender and various medical conditions in the patient's background. This feature is useful for disease analysis within the hospital environment.
2. **Create**, The Hospital Admission CRUD Function enables the registration of new patients along with their medical history, including details such as diabetes and hypertension.
3. **Update**, The Hospital Admission CRUD Function allows you to update existing patient databases.
4. **Delete**, The function provides the capability to remove patient records that you do not need from the database.
5. **Analyze**, Acting as an early monitoring system for patients before they receive treatment from a doctor, this feature categorizes patients based on their level of risk. This enables early intervention following patient registration.
